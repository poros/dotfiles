# aactivator sets the prompt in a way which is not compatible with how we do it,
# since we need to store $? for setting :) or :(
# the way to get around it is to init aactivator before and then putting our prompt
# command before the aactivator one in bashrc-common-prompt
which aactivator > /dev/null 2>&1 && eval "$(aactivator init)"
